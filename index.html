        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Derek McElroy! Currently, I'm attending "We Can Code It"'s Bootcamp, and I'm super excited about delving deeper into the world of Java Full Stack Development. For the past 5 years, I've been a learning trainer at Amazon, where I've had the opportunity to enhance my skills with various Microsoft tools. One tool that I excel in is Microsoft Excel—I've become quite the pro with it!</p>
            <p>One thing about me is that I'm a self-taught enthusiast. I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge, especially when it comes to programming. It's a field that never fails to challenge and excite me, and I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to broaden my horizons.</p>
            <p>Now, onto my hobbies and interests. I proudly identify as a weeb/nerd/geek—call it what you will! Anime, Dr. Who, and action/comedy flicks are some of my favorite things to watch. When I have the chance, I enjoy playing tabletop games like D&D—it's such a fantastic way to immerse myself in a rich, imaginative world. If I can't dedicate an entire evening to gaming, I'll satisfy my craving by delving into a few captivating chapters of a book each week.</p>
            <p>Although I may not be as heavily into gaming as before, I still dabble occasionally. League of Legends and the good ol' "Everquest" hold a special place in my heart. However, what truly gets my heart racing is the thought of exploring different cuisines and flavors. Coffee, tea, and any type of cuisine—I'm always up for trying something new!</p>
            <p>So, that's a little snapshot of who I am. Eager learner, lover of anime and movies, tabletop game enthusiast, occasional gamer, and an adventurous foodie. I'm constantly seeking new experiences and challenges, both in my professional and personal life. Nice to meet you!</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>Most of my current work is all Excel based. Here are a few of the projects I've created for amazon that have been used across multiple sites in our network!</p>

            <h3>Action Report</h3>
                <img src="/assets/images/Action_Report.JPG">
                <p>The Action Report is a tool I built to give my Learning Team visibility on all of the individual training records needed per associate, and to also ensure training was completed and met all compliance</p>

            <h3>Ambassador Tracker</h3>
            <img src="/assets/images/Ambassador_Tracker.JPG">
                <p>As a learning Trainer, It was my job to properly keep tabs on all of the Ambassadors that assisted me in my training. At any given time, we have over One Hundred associates working for us as training ambassadors. This tool was designed to help my learning team keep track of our ambassadors, their availability, and skill sets</p>

            <h3>Attendence Helper</h3>
            <img src="/assets/images/Attendence_Helper.JPG">
                <p>This super simple tool packs quite a punch! As a trainer, we often needed to conduct mass skill sets trainings in a given window, off of a given list. A common barrier was determining whom was on site to receive said training. I built and designed this tool so we could identify whom was on site, and with the use of a departments board scan, determine their location as well</p>
